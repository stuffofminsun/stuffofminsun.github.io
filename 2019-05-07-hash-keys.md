title: dynamodb keys

Spent some of the morning redoing DynamoDB tables, after realizing a throughput of 2 up/2 down is actually too small for the visualization. After experimenting with combining tables, I get how flexible the schema really is - beyond sharing a relatively unique partition key/sort key combo, the documents can all be quite irregularly shaped. On the other hand, after building my key setup I had to abandon it after realizing that DynamoDB does not allow begins_with() on the hash key, only on the range key. 

In the meantime, working with SEC Edgar XML files to build my next project.
