This is a portfolio and ~~adventures~~ misadventures of programming blog. I also have a language blog elsewhere, since I'm currently studying Japanese as well and hope to eventually pass the N2 (at JLPT N3 level now this year). I work in finance and, beginning fall 2019, I'll also be a masters student at the University of Michigan.
