This is a portfolio and ~~adventures~~ misadventures of programming blog. I also have a language blog elsewhere, since I'm currently studying Japanese as well and hope to eventually pass the N2 (at JLPT N3 level now this year) before I go on and move to doing the TOPIK exams. I work in finance and, beginning fall 2019, I'm also a masters student.
