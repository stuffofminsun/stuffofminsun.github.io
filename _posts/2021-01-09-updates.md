Still forgot about my github. But this time, actually doing
something about it.

2020 (and 2019 lookbacks):
* learned to use Spark (not very well but still)
* learned to use Kafka 
* learned (a little bit) more bash
* learned more about CNN
* Finished AOC 2020 and bought a tshirt
* got significantly better at certain python libraries

2021 resolutions:
* give in and start using OO programming in python.
* play more with deep learning libraries. 
* learn to write in a new language.

That's it. Nothing major.
