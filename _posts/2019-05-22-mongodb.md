Spent the last week and a half working through MongoDB's M001 (MongoDB Basics) and M220P (MongoDB for Python Developers) courses. I guess they roll these courses constantly into the next 'semester' as soon as the first week passes, because I started with M001 and only added M220P because I finished the course in about three days and saw 220 was still open. Went ahead to register for M121 (MongoDB Aggregation Framework) for June, mostly because it's quite nice working with MongoDB. It also doesn't seem to be that similar to  DynamoDB.

The 220 course came with a sample Flask app, which was a nice example to thumb through.
