title: powerbi again
---

Working my way through building a variety of sample PowerBI visualizations; I'm hoping to be able to replace certain Powerpoint presentations we have since PowerBI can be turned into a pdf or be interactive and still be good looking while also simultaneously being much easier to update, datawise (of the entirety of the Office Suite, I dislike Powerpoint the most). Also slowly learning to use DAX. One downside so far is that I have to keep to using the 32 bit version of PowerBI because the rest of my Office suite is 32bit, which unfortunately leads to peculiar interactions with anything 64 bit. 

Also testing to see how python interacts with PowerBI. As I understand it, R is well integrated but Python might not be. Wondering if I should just give in and learn the basics of R, if only to try out Shiny.
