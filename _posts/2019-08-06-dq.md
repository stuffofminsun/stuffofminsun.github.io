Haven't been working much on projects - went on a short summer trip, came back and decided to see how fast I could get through dataquest.io. I started working on the data engineer path first before changing my mind and going back to see how the data analyst path was structured first. It's pretty easy so far since it assumes little to no knowledge of python so made it through roughly 17% of the path in about... 12ish hours? Give or take? I learned a handful of new things (working with datetime, which I don't do a lot of, and some file manipulation in numpy, which I'd discard in favor of just going straight into pandas dataframes) but so far find it all right. Maybe a more detailed review later after I hit the end of the free trial in all paths. Didn't quite think it was worth a full annual membership, even at the 50% discount, though.
