I have discovered the ~~magic~~ teeth grinding frustration of pandas. I can certainly see how it is a very useful tool, and can do a great many things, but I'm at the stage where I know just barely enough to run it and every execution takes me many, many more minutes than what it would've taken me in a sql statement or, heck, excel, in seconds if it was a small enough file.

Presumably, however, I am not working with a file less than 1.4 million rows if I am doing it in pandas, so I'm going to keep on truckin'.

I also saw the market cap over time visualization somewhat recently (two weeks ago, I think?) and I was mesmerized - it's been a while since I looked at a visualization and realized, huh, I learned something interesting from it. I am dying to learn to write a version of it myself and I think I have the right dataset to use it, too, provided I am willing to spend some time reacquainting myself with call report data again.
