Finished (https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis/home/welcome)[Introduction to Data Science in Python from Coursera]. Fast and fun, although a little frustrating. 

I recently purchased a Dell XPS 13 for my laptop, after looking through lightweight laptops for a while and deciding against going with an Asus of similar specs. Pretty happy with it, although it's got a slightly squeaky backspace and I'm still trying to get used to the pgup and pgdn being literally next to the arrow keys; more than once I've mashed into either. Did I ever mention how much I love Micro Center? It's so close by and there's two rather delicious places worth going near the Brooklyn center (Bay Market Kitchen and Ejen). 

Going to spend the next couple of days on UIPath, since a friend of mine is bugging me to get certified so... we can talk about it? I think? Not sure. 

Dates are the bane of my life.
