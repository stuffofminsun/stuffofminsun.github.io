title: bokeh & redshift

bokeh's ok. I think my hangup with it was mostly with the bokeh server related stuff but then it was the same issue with dash so I can't really remember why I ended up choosing plotly so many months back when I needed something animated because I do remember looking at both libraries to get something done. I can push 'em all to heroku anyway so... it doesn't matter? 

I think the downside to coding again is remembering to put up music playlists on random rotation again before I listen to the same song on repeat for 8 hours without noticing. Not really a fan of spotify, though. Maybe I should set up a music server at home. 

Note to self: shut down your AWS Redshift instance when you're done experimenting with it before you wake up to a $125 bill the following month for provisioning it.
