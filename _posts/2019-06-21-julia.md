Spent all day wrestling with DAX for building measures. It caught me by surprise that it's also used in power pivot in Excel, but when I went and looked up what, exactly, power pivot does in Excel again I remembered why I don't use it (or power query, for that matter). I have created _one_ item in Excel that pulls from Access in a fit of desperation and I will never do it again. Also, I'm getting really frustrated with PowerBI desktop because either it's just a regular thing that it crashes all the time or it's just a 32bit thing meshing poorly with random 32bit and 64bit things, but this crashing is bad, and frustrating, and somewhat demoralizing too. 

In between breaks from monkeying around with DAX in PowerBI (kind of guessing haphazardly how it works based on other queries and intermittently looking up the documentation online) I went and read about Julia instead. Seems really elegant, but I really ought to go back and work through R. Scala's kind of up there too.
