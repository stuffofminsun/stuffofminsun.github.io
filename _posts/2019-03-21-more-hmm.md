title: More hmm than not
---

I finished the Python Functions, Files and Dictionaries course yesterday on Coursera, and then finished both the Data Collection and Classes/Inheritance courses after it today. All of these are fairly fast to finish if you've come in from another language, and to be fair, I charged right into writing a web scraper right after learning basic syntax in the Basics course, so there were a lot of things I learned from trial and error already. I like these courses mostly because the textbook is completely separate from the video and they constantly reinforce learning with exercises and questions throughout the text. Didn't finish the last course in the specialization mostly because it won't start for another 15 days.

Decided to move onto the data science specialization. In the meantime, plan to rewrite some of my scrapers and do a before and after look through to see what I learned. My older slightly wordy Java style in the older text is noticeable and plan on rewriting to streamline code.

Still tinkering with this page. May mess with the css files some more.
