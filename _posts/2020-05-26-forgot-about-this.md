Forgot about my github. I had projects (still do, actually), but it's being superceded by uh, other things. Got a chance to look at a full fledged ETL setup and it's really neat and disciplined and I am a fan. Definitely something I want to build for myself when I get the chance. Also reading through the docs for Ray and thinking about what I can do with it. 

Been refactoring some stuff and looking through my old projects. I need to figure out what to do for my graduate milestone and wondering which data I can use or scrape to use for it. Should be something I'm nominally interested in - it's is a 2 month course after all, I might as well like the subject I'm working with - but feeling a little uninspired about what I have. Maybe I should look to mortgage data and see how performance was like during Covid, but might be a little premature by the time the milestone happens in August. 

Also found out from a classmate that AWS RDS has a free tier. Did they always? Always thought the bulk of it was with their nosql service, DynamoDB. Hmmm, worth a try at spinning up a postgres instance there to store my milestone data. 

Also, who is using my dyno projects??? Argh I'm blowing through a million hours on heroku's 13f stuff. whoopsy.
