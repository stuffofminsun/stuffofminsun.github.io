Put together another <a href="https://minsun-muni.herokuapp.com/">visualization</a> experimenting with one input (button) and multiple outputs. I started with a dropdown, but it wasn't particularly ideal for what I wanted to do- I wanted the items to animate over time but couldn't quite get the hang of dash's animation library. Callbacks also don't bind to keys (except for the enter key using n-submit), so I compromised with paging through data using a button which, as long as it maintains focus, can be activated with the space bar or enter key. 

There's some munging with FDIC call report data, which you can download yourself <a href="https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/PWS/DownloadBulkData.aspx">here</a>. A fair warning, no matter how you mess with the data, you'll never reach the totals that the FDIC reports in their quarterly banking profile because the bulk downloads don't include savings institutions. The visualization uses a csv file generated from the results of the munging, since the unpacking and cleaning didn't need to really be done every time the visualization refreshed. The data are stored in the zip files generated by the FFIEC in a directory, so adding another zip file per quarter is just a matter of rerunning the <a href="https://www.stuffofminsun.com/files/fdic-muni-deploy.html">notebook</a>. Keeping the zip files intact and keeping the munging separate from the visualization also means it's very easy to deploy using another field (e.g., corporate bond holdings).

Anyway, this was also a fairly fast deploy where most of the time spent was just building the visualization to look and feel right.
