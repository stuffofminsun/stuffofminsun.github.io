Built out the 13f visualization a bit more today. It was initially planned to be a MongoDB Atlas backend,  a daily ETL job done by Heroku, and a PowerBI visualization front, but... it turns out that you need to be on an Atlas M10 cluster to use the PowerBI connector so, well, that was that, and went back to Dash (yet again). Sketched out the beginnings of a visualization where you can select either the company or the security and see what securities the company is holding, or what companies that bought a particular security. More a proof of concept than anything else; MongoDB's Atlas 512Mb free cluster is wholly unsuited for this as a quarter's worth of data would probably exceed the cluster - I've seen upwards to half a million rows of securities data pulled from SEC Edgar from the RSS feed per day. I could probably do something larger scale with DynamoDB's 25 GB limit, but wanted to explore MongoDB's features more fully. Also formally started properly building tests in python as I should've been doing that ages ago. 

PowerBI is interesting. Feels just a bit unfinished, like it could be much more heavily featured but they've been deliberately adding new items one at a time. Some of the WYSISYG features are kind of difficult to deal with, as they often kind of break every time you try to reload data. But you can pull together some nifty interactive visualizations that you definitely can't do in Excel, at least in a user-friendly way.
