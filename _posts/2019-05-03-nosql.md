Wow, coming in knowingly only RDBMS systems, a nosql version is a little difficult to get used to. Spent most of the afternoon reading DynamoDB documentation and experimenting on queries on a tiny table. Just trying to pull a series of rows between x and y date, something that is a nobrainer in a rdbms system, took a... lot longer than I was expected.
