Wow, coming in knowing only RDBMS systems, nosql databases are... quite a bit different. Spent most of the afternoon reading DynamoDB documentation and experimenting on queries on a tiny table. Just trying to pull a series of rows between x and y date, something that is a nobrainer in a rdbms system, took a... lot longer than I expected. 

I finished all my visualizations on agency trades! Well, almost. They run but the background definitely needs a little bit of cleanup.
