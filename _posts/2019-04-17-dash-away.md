title: dash!

Wow, dash/plotly is pretty cool. Managed to pull together a whole interactive visualization from a dataframe after a few hours of tinkering. The dataframe to table thing that they rolled out recently is nice but is definitely pretty limited in scope, though. 

The nice thing about dash/plotly is being able to avoid Javascript - it's one language I know virtually nothing and pretty much all visualizations seem to rely on one way or another. The downside is that dash makes you very, very aware of how important indenting is in python and how easy it is to mess up when it's ~~turtles~~ parentheses all the way down... 

Guess I'll spend tomorrow figuring out how to deploy to Heroku.
